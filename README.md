# daygrid.css - Yet Another Grid
I make use of this boilerplate grid quite a lot so I wanted to demonstrate how it works, to further my own understanding and to show others that media queries are not that scary.

## Getting Started

### What does it look like?
Head over to [daygrid.dwy.io](http://daygrid.dwy.io) to see what it is all about and get an idea of what the grid system entails.

### Goals and Requirements
* Be easy to use
* Be under 1000 lines of CSS
* Be reuseable

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

## Contributing
Please create a github issue with your suggested change and submit a pull request against it for consideration.

## To-Do
* More Breakpoints
* Better Text

## Licence
See the file `LICENSE` in the repository root directory.

## Acknowledgements
Inspired by another of other css frameworks, mostly [this one](http://getskeleton.com/).
